# Frameshift UI architecture modernization — completed plan

**Status:** Final architecture implemented and enforced on 2026-07-18.

The frontend remains a zero-build, native-ES-module application served directly
by Flask and packaged recursively by PyInstaller. The modernization is complete:
the monolith has been replaced by typed domain modules, named API clients,
feature-owned state, safe rendering, layered CSS, and behavior-level tests.

The living contribution contract is
[`UI_ARCHITECTURE.md`](UI_ARCHITECTURE.md). This plan records the delivered
target and its acceptance gates.

## Final decisions

| Area | Final decision |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Native ESM, no bundler, no runtime packages, no CDN assets |
| Types | Strict TypeScript `checkJs` over production JavaScript with JSDoc contracts |
| State | One typed `ApplicationState` store; mutable workspace state stays feature-owned |
| API | Named domain clients with explicit request/response contracts |
| Rendering | Escaping `html\`\`` templates and one reviewed DOM write boundary |
| Markup | Static pane views under `features/views/`; runtime data rendered by features |
| Controls | Idempotent pane wiring under `features/controls/`; bootstrap only composes |
| CSS | Declared cascade layers with one stylesheet entrypoint |
| Tests | Vitest module tests, Chromium journeys, WebKit tablet journeys, isolated Python scripts |
| Release | Repeat all gates before packaging, then verify the served executable’s ESM graph |

Framework adoption, a state library, a transpilation pipeline, an SPA router,
SSR, and a third-party component library are outside the architecture. The
existing imperative DOM model and Holo Bracket component system remain the
right fit for an offline cockpit interface.

## Delivered module graph

```text
ui/
  index.html
  panel-bootstrap.js
  hb.js
  src/
    main.js
    core/
    api/
      contracts/
    data/
    features/
      controls/
      views/
    shell/
    bootstrap/
  styles/
    index.css
    tokens/
    base/
    components/
    features/
    panel/
    themes/
    motion/
```

`reset` is a reserved logical cascade layer, not a source directory.

The enforced import direction is:

```text
core/data <- api <- features/shell <- bootstrap <- main
```

The dependency gate resolves every production import, rejects missing and bare
runtime specifiers, checks layer direction, and fails every cycle.

## Delivered state and commander model

`core/store.js` owns `createStore<ApplicationState>()`. `/api/state` is
published as one complete typed snapshot. Feature renderers read the store
directly or receive an explicitly typed slice.

Commander isolation uses two values:

- `commander_id`, the stable storage and backend discriminator; and
- store generation, which invalidates all work captured before a profile
  change.

Commander-scoped API methods set `scope: "commander"`. The HTTP layer requires a
current identity, sends `X-Frameshift-Commander`, aborts scoped requests during
a handoff, and rejects stale responses. Features verify the captured identity
again before committing workspace state or user-visible errors.

Browser persistence uses stable commander IDs. Display names are never
isolation keys.

Archived-profile selection is an offline viewer, not a second live identity.
The server and journal share one re-entrant transition guard, live
cross-profile activation fails closed, and the next live event restores the
journal commander before dispatch. Every journal-derived analytics or
tracked-market write carries that explicit commander ID.

## Delivered API boundary

Every domain client under `ui/src/api/`, except `index.js`, `query.js`, and
`errors.js`, imports its matching explicit contract. `system.js` imports the
`ApplicationState` contract.

Client methods return named response DTOs. Generic response declarations such
as `Promise<unknown>`, `Promise<Record<string, unknown>>`, or inline Promise
object types fail the architecture gate.

Only `core/http.js` may call `fetch()`. Presentation and bootstrap modules may
not import the transport or embed API paths.

## Delivered safety boundary

Dynamic HTML uses `html\`\`` and `render()`. Interpolated API, journal, EDDN,
extension, localStorage, and form values are escaped. Direct HTML sinks outside
the central renderer fail the architecture gate.

The server enforces a self-only script CSP. UI assets use `no-cache`, API
responses use `no-store`, and `X-Frameshift-Version` coordinates a single
browser reload when an updated server replaces the running module graph.

## Zero-tolerance source gates

Production JavaScript must satisfy all of the following:

- zero `@ts-nocheck`;
- zero explicit JSDoc `any`, including `Record<string, any>`;
- zero `legacy-base.js` or `legacy-runtime.js` files or imports;
- zero generated mechanical-transition comments;
- zero literal mojibake in shipped JavaScript, HTML, or CSS;
- at most 400 lines for every non-data module;
- at most 550 lines for each module under `ui/src/data/`;
- explicit contracts for every domain API client; and
- named, non-generic Promise response DTOs.

The architecture checker has a focused self-test mode:

```text
node tools/check_ui_architecture.mjs --self-test
```

It proves both accepted examples and every zero-tolerance rejection independently
of the current source tree.

## Performance acceptance gate

`tools/check_ui_performance_budget.mjs` enforces:

| Budget | Limit |
|---|---:|
| Production modules | 145 |
| Production JavaScript | 768 KiB |
| Stylesheets | 180 KiB |
| HTML shell | 4 KiB |
| Single production module | 24 KiB |

These budgets protect startup and recursive ESM fetch cost on LAN tablets and
the desktop WebView. A feature that crosses a budget is reorganized or replaces
equivalent code before release.

## Browser acceptance gate

Playwright runs two projects:

- `chromium` executes the complete desktop and shared journey suite.
- `webkit-tablet` executes `@tablet` journeys with an iPad Pro landscape
  profile.

CI installs both browsers on Windows and Linux. The harness fixes locale,
timezone, viewport, scale, and reduced motion; retains traces and failure
screenshots; and applies a bounded screenshot-diff tolerance.

Desktop tabs and Panel pages remain two presentations of the same application
state. Changes to shared functionality cover both when applicable.

## Static and unit acceptance gate

`npm run verify:frontend` runs:

1. entrypoint syntax checks;
2. architecture and dependency checks;
3. the DOM ID contract;
4. CSS layer/import/size checks;
5. performance budgets;
6. formatting and ESLint;
7. strict `checkJs`; and
8. Vitest.

Tests import behavior through the ESM graph. Source-text assertions against
implementation files and `node:vm` bundle execution are prohibited.

## Python test-entrypoint gate

Python test files run in separate processes so their isolated application-data
directories remain deterministic. CI calls:

```text
python tools/run_python_test_file.py tests/test_example.py
```

The wrapper parses the file, records every local `test_*` function, profiles the
script execution, and fails if any discovered test function was not invoked.
This preserves script-style tests without allowing silent pytest-only
definitions.

## Release acceptance gate

The release workflow repeats the complete frontend verification, Chromium and
WebKit journeys, and every isolated Python test before building
`Frameshift.exe`.

After packaging, the workflow starts the executable in headless mode and runs
`tools/verify_served_ui.py`. Publication is blocked unless the verifier can:

- fetch the document and recursively traverse the same-origin ESM graph;
- reject bare or cross-origin module specifiers;
- observe one expected `X-Frameshift-Version` on every response;
- confirm `no-cache` on UI assets; and
- confirm `no-store` on `/api/state`.

Checksums and the retained alternate executable filename are produced only
after the packaged smoke test succeeds.

## Completion criteria

The modernization is accepted when all of these commands pass:

```text
node tools/check_ui_architecture.mjs --self-test
npm run verify:frontend
npm run test:e2e:ci
```

Release acceptance additionally requires every Python test file through
`tools/run_python_test_file.py` and the packaged served-graph smoke test.

Future frontend work extends this architecture; it does not add alternate
state, transport, rendering, boot, or test paths.
